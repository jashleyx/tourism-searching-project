<b>The "Tourism Searching Mini Project"</b> is a website designed to search for tourist destinations 
based on the following requirements:
1) Users can enter search queries in the input field to search for tourist destinations.
- If the website is opened, and the user has not entered any text in the input field,
the system should display all available data from the server.
2) Users should see search results displayed as a list of tourist destinations in a user-friendly UI.
- The search results displayed on the UI should be fetched from the server.
- The description should be limited to a maximum of 100 characters.
- The UI should display the title, description, and a large image (taken from the first item in the 'photos' key within the server response). 
This information is sufficient for this task.
3) When users click the "Read More" button, a link should open in a new tab of their web browser. The link will be obtained from the 'url' property.

In this project, I focused on learning how to develop a REST API to retrieve data from a server and display it on a website. 
This involved working with RESTful API concepts and utilizing Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, to build and manage the API. 
The goal is to create a seamless interaction between the web application and the server, enabling you to fetch and present data dynamically on the website.
